A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,

Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
But I have that within which passeth show;

O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
MARCELLUS
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
HORATIO
A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
HORATIO
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,

A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark

O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
HAMLET
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
I have sworn 't.

When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,

A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?

With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;

Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,

O, throw away the worser part of it,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Pointing to POLONIUS
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What shall I do?

Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
